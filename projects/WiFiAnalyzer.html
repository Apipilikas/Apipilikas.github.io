                    <h2>What is Towards Green?</h2>
                    <p>Towards Green (TG) is a new app that is intented to help municipalities come closer to the 
                        citizens and vice versa. Municipalities often delay to do even the simple tasks like cleaning a park. 
                        Other than that, they seem to struggle to keep track of open issues in the community. Towards Green is 
                        here to deal with all this problems, having citizen as the main focus. Should one want to use the app, 
                        one will have to create an Account. After that, one can through a simply and cozy interface share issues 
                        that have come to one's attention, take part in volunteering events and many more that are described detaily 
                        at the "Main App features" section.

                    <h2>Main reason of this project</h2>
                    <p>
                        As I have already mentioned, this project has been implemented for the course Application Development of Computer 
                        Systems at AUEB for the year 2021-2022. We were asked to foster a pioneering idea for an upcoming app. In a world 
                        that constanly changes and demands people's attention more than ever before, there is nothing else but environment 
                        that could draw our interest.

                                        from supervisors, since they are the only ones with the privilege to create these.
                                        Every event displays all the appropriate information one will want to know. For example,
                                        an event should have the place, the time and the location that is going to take place. Other
                                        than that there are some extra optional features that a supervisor can fill, like a badge or
                                        details about the equipment that is needed. User can then react as long as the event is open. One 
                                        can understand the status of the event by watching the container on the top corner of an event with 
                                        label "Κατάσταση". If the status changes to something else, user will not have the opportunity to react
                                        neither attend the event.

                                        This is the event creation page that a supervisor can redirect in to create an event. Supervisor has the privilege to
                                        turn a post into an event. If a post has drew supervisor's interest and has many reactions, one can create an event from that.
                                        Then one will have to choose the date, the time, the location and can add a badge or details for equipment.
